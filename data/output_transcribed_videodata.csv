Providing you follow some simple rules and rule. Number one is to buy a in sniffer. This tool is a must-have for DIY electricians and you can buy one for under 15 bucks. I'll show you how to use one a little later. So let's say you want to change a light fixture in this room or you'd like to put in a fancy new Switch or update an electrical outlet before you pull off any cover plates or disassemble, any light fixtures, the first step is to shut off the electricity for that circuit. Right now, the switches lights and Outlets are fully Just with electricity, we need to D energize, the circuit, at the main electrical panel at the main panel, check the circuit breaker directory, to identify the circuit that you're working on. But know this circuit breaker directories are often incomplete inaccurate or even non-existent. So you can't always rely on them. If the circuit is clearly marked, shut off the breaker and go check to make sure it's dead as will show you in a minute. If the panel isn't clearly marked will use the lights and Outlets or switches to help find the correct breaker. If you're changing a light fixture or upgrading a switch turn on the light before switching off the breaker, if you're working on an outlet plug in and turn on a lamp or radio a radios. Great. If you're alone providing you can hear it at the main electrical panel as you shut off circuit breakers. If you have a helper have them holler when the lighter radio shuts off. But if the main panel is really, remote, use cell phones to communicate with your helper to confirm that. The circuit is off, I'll use a voltage sniffer. But first I want to make sure the sniffer is working by testing it in a live Outlet. Turn it on and stick the probe into the small slot on the outlet. It has to be the small slot you test. The larger slot is a neutral and May Activate the tester. Here are a couple things you should know about sniffers. First of all, Believe It or Not, these things have batteries. So, if it doesn't seem to be working properly, change the battery. Secondly, sniffer shut themselves off after a while, to save battery life. So be sure. It's on before, testing anything for voltage, if you're working on a fixture, pull it free and sniffer on the wires to make sure it's dead. Even though the light may be off, it's very possible that there are Still live wires in the electrical box, if it's an outlet or switch back out the mounting screws and pull the device out of the box, be sure to keep your fingers clear, the terminal screws just in case. Now verify that it's dead by sniffing around the terminal screws and the other wires inside the box if they're dead, you're ready to go ahead and safely, do your electrical work but let's say you're not able to complete the work right away. Perhaps you need to run to the store or Finish the next day to keep the work Zone. Safe clip off the bare wires and cap. Each one off with a small wire nut. As you can see, it's really pretty easy to work on electrical fixtures and Outlets without the fear of getting a big old electrical jolt. The key is shutting off the correct, circuit breaker and confirming that the juices off with a sniffer."

If you get sloppy with your connections, you'll not only have headaches down the road, you could have dangerous electrical arcs and loose connections, that cause arcing are a leading cause of electrical fires as always before beginning any home. Um, electrical work, shut off the circuit breaker, powering the circuit you're working on. There are really two main types of wire connections to know about wire to wire and wire to device. I'll start with the basics for wire to wire connections, almost all wire to wire connections are done with what are technically called twc's, which stands for twist-on wire connector. Most people just call them wire nuts. They have a sharp edge coil of Inside that digs into the bare copper wire for good solid. Contact wire nuts. Come in various sizes. It's important to choose the right one based on the gauges and quantities of the wires. You're joining wire, nut containers have that information printed right on the label. So be sure to choose the right wire nut for the job. If you're gearing up for General, electrical work by a variety pack that includes all of the wire nut sizes, you'll need to join two wires. H strip away a half inch of insulation, hold them together with the ends, even and then Twist on the wire nut, keep twisting until the insulated part of the wires wrap around each other. A couple of times, then give the nut a tug to make sure the connection is secure. Some people think it's necessary to First twist the bare wires together before twisting on the wire nut. It's okay to do that step, but it's not needed. If you're joining stranded wires to solid wires, hold the strands just a bit beyond the end of the solid wire. Then Twist on the wire nut. Now, let's move on to making connections with devices and light fixtures. The term device is the catch-all word for outlets and switches there. Actually a few different ways to attach wires to devices but some are better than others. Most devices have little holes with internal Barb's. These are called stab ins some electricians like them because it's much faster to use a stab in than wrapping wires around terminal screws although stabbings are code approved. The most secure method is to Loop the wire around the terminal screws. Begin the loop method by stripping the wire about three quarters of an inch Then use the hole in the wire stripper to create a loop wrap. The loop around the screw in a clockwise Direction and snug the loop with a needle nose, pliers, or the nose of your wire stripper, then tighten up the terminal, screw, that's the way you connect to any terminal. Screw whether it's a device, a lighting fixture, or anything else. And here's the important part, the wires need to connect to the proper color. Coded terminal, brass colored screws always connect to black or red hot wires. Silver screws are for neutral or white wires and green screws are always for ground. Wires, don't cut Corners when you're making electrical connections. This is one of those DIY jobs when it really counts to do it, right."

Since the brick, in fact, most likely your house is completely wired with it. Most electricians call it. Romex while romics is a specific brand name of nonmetallic sheathed cable, the Name has become synonymous with all nonmetallic, sheathed cable, the Rome wire company of Rome, New York invented, the product in 1922 and named it. Romex nonmetallic. Sheathed cable has been unofficially called Romex ever since before beginning any electrical work. Shut off the circuit breaker powering the circuit to work with cable, you'll need a few specialty tools, a cable Ripper for slitting. The sheathing, without damaging the internal wires. A lineman's pliers for cutting off cable twisting, wires and many other tasks, and a wire stripper for stripping insulation from the wires and then bending hooks on the ends for wrapping around terminal screws, cable comes in many different forms. Depending on the use, you'll find everything you need to know printed right here on the sheathing. The first number is the gauge or thickness of the wire. In this case, it's 12 gauge wire, which nowadays days always has yellow sheathing. The numbers following that tells you how many conductors there are? This cable is called 12 to, with ground, because it has two wires that carry current. The black wire carries, the 120 volt current, the white wire is the neutral and the bare copper wire is the ground, but there are other types of cable as well. Including what's called three conductor with ground? That style is Rated as 12 3 or 14-3 with ground. This type of cable is used mostly for three-way switching and for wiring 240-volt appliances the black and red wires. Can each carry 120 volts? The beefier of the to 12 gauge cable is used for 20-amp circuits in areas. Like garages or kitchens that have fixtures machines or appliances that demand more power 14. Age cable is used for more common 15, amp circuits, that demand less power. Another type of cable is called UF which stands for underground feeder. This cable is meant to be directly buried in the ground, without the protection of conduit or pipe. It's different than other cable because it has additional insulation between each conductor to make it waterproof, durable and tough. Now that you know, some Basics, let's cover a few tips about King with electrical cable. If you just need a few feet of cable, it's fine to just pull it out of the package and cut it off. But if you're running long lengths of cable, pull it out, and eliminate the coils before, installing itDrill holes, so that they line up to make pulling cable, easier, drill three quarter inch holes for up to two cables. These holes need to be at least one and a quarter inches back from the edge of the framing then they'll never get punctured by the nails or screws when the room gets finished. If for any reason, the cable is closer to the edge of the framing, add nailing plates to protect the cable from nail or screw punctures. Running cable between studs. Like this is fine. As long as the wall is getting covered with drywall, but if the walls will remain open, this isn't allowed because the cable is vulnerable to damage and abuse instead keep the cables hugging the framing. So, it's protected in this garage, the cable doesn't skip from stud to stud instead, it runs tight against the studs across the top of the wall, and then back down another stud to feed the next Outlet. That way. The wire is not as vulnerable to abuse and damage. If you're feeding a new electrical box, strip the cable first before putting it into the box and before stapling near the Box slit, the she think with a cable stripper at least 10 inches from the end. Pull it back and cut it off. At the beginning of the slit, pull the paper away from the ground wire and remove it feed the cable into the box. Make sure about 1/4 of an inch. An inch of insulation projects into the box to protect the wires against the sharp plastic edges. It's important to secure the cable, to the framing with staples that are designed for nonmetallic cable. Here are a few do's and don'ts regarding stapling staple cable, no, more than six inches from each electrical box and then every four feet Feet thereafter. Those are the basics of working with electrical cable. Get yourself a few dedicated, electrical tools, and you're ready to do, a little wiring."

Like we can't control external events and we hear all this stuff like meditate vacation massage, I'll do all this stuff but that's great. But what if you're stressed in the moment, right? You're about to give a talk or you're in a difficult conversation or the world seems to be spinning around you. The physiological sigh brings your level stress down immediately very quickly and we all have the capacity to do it and it's done in the following way. It's a double inhale through the The nose. The first one is a complete. Inhale to your lungs, feel full, and then you sneak in a little bit more air as a second. Inhale, and then a long slow, exhale through the mouth. Should we all your lungs are completely empty?"
