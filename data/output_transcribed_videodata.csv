This course is all about how to get your ideas approved by your stakeholders. It's the same method used by the world's Elite consulting firms, they help their clients make really difficult decisions and put forward recommendations. That have quite frankly, a lot of impact on the organization you're going to learn in this course, how to define the question. What's the issue and why did your stakeholder care? R, you'll then formulate, an initial hypothesis. What do you think the answer is? Then I'll walk through how to structure your argument. We're going to build what I call an architecture for your logic. This is a step that a lot of people are unfamiliar with and it's really the heart of this entire method. Once you have an architecture, you'll turn it into a story. Very simple narrative that your audience can follow. And remember then we'll talk about how to discuss that story with key stakeholders and get their input as well as start building some buy-in for your recommendation will identify the required analysis because you do need facts to make your case. But we're going to be focused in the analysis that we do, you'll then prove or disprove your hypothesis and then package your recommendation. And it can be Form of a memo presentation, a hallway conversation, that's not important, at the beginning of the process. What you really need to understand is what's your idea and why should your stakeholder care? What worry, about slides at the end of The process? By the time you finish applying this method, you'll have Clarity on what matters to your stakeholder. You'll have a clear argument. They'll know exactly why you're making your case and you'll pitch your idea in a way that resonates for them. And hopefully gets them to sign on the line. Let's start building your case."

Let's take a look at what most people do today. If you look at the organization where you're trying to pitch ideas, there's usually a hierarchy of folks you need to get approval from from your manager and some peers. All the way up through your directors and your VPS and sometimes even up to the c-suite. And there's this Dynamic that happens. Where different people need different types of information. I like to call this figlio loads law, which states, an individual's annual compensation is inversely proportional to the number of slides. They'll look at before they have a stroke, senior Executives don't want to see a lot of slides. I worked with one CEO who said if it has a staple, I won't read it. Nothing more than one page. I worked with another CEO where two teams went into present. We went second by the way, you should always go. Second so you can watch Team One implode and don't do whatever they did. They handed him their presentation, it was about 30 pages or so he picked it up, he felt it for half, look them dead in the I threw it across the room and said, talk to me. What do you want? I'm busy. We knew better, we had three slides. The difference between the first group and our group was, they were telling him everything, they knew, we were going to tell him everything he needed to know. There is a huge difference between those two approaches and the structure thought in communication process. Helps you identify? What is the information? Your audience needs. So, let's look at some common practices that people apply today. Day, usually, they'll start with the data. We've got tons of information and we'll build spreadsheets and run queries and pull data out of databases. Then we look for an insight though. The graph went up. I thought it was going to go down. There must be something insightful there. Well, then put together an 80-page thick in comprehensible presentation so we can show everybody how hard we've been working and how rigorous we've been. We then share that 80-page presentation in a 30-minute meeting, do the math it. Work and about 15 minutes in. You see people just glazing over. You've lost them and then we walk out of that meeting with no decision and not know, because they didn't like your idea. No, because they didn't understand your idea and what the benefits are to them. We do this all the time. That methods, lengthy, it's inefficient, most of that analysis you do will not see the light of day. You'll walk out of that meeting with people scratching their heads and No decision made. And then, you know what, we have to do have another meeting, yay, it doesn't work right and you lose credibility as a leader. When you do this, people don't know what your recommendation is, they're not going to follow you. So the structure thought process is designed to fix these problems with the structured thought process. We start with the question, we understand what the issue is and why does the stakeholder want it solved? Then we Generate an initial hypothesis. What do we think? The answer is we also link it to a metric or an objective that that stakeholder has, that's how we make the case resonate. Well then build the argument. We're going to structure our logic will build what I call an architecture to make our case. Then you'll turn it into a very simple narrative that flows. And if you have a solid architecture with a logical structure, it makes writing the story. Really easy. Then the next step can get people a little uncomfortable, you have to go out and talk to people and solicit input. Early in the process, you want to know what the objections are going to be and what the risks are before you do a lot of work. Once you've done that syndication with your key stakeholders, you'll identify the required facts, prove, or disprove that hypothesis. And then package your idea. This method is efficient, it's going to help you focus on the most meaningful analyses. You need to do. Do and then avoid all the ones that are irrelevant. It's also efficient, because we get to yes on the first shot. Maybe the second we're not going to have to have meeting after meeting after meeting to make a decision. The method is also effective, I have gotten millions of dollars of investment at a bunch of different companies. I've worked for, because I've used this method to make my case. Now what I see a lot of times is people want to dive into the data because it's tangible, they can get a sense for what's going on. They think with this method, I need you to get comfortable with the ambiguity at the beginning of the process. In the early stages, you're going to be on scratch paper or a whiteboard as you define the question and generate your core idea. When you go to build your architecture, find a whiteboard. If I could have all four walls of my office, be a whiteboard. I Would because there are so important to being able to structure your logic and see it all in front of you. Once you've built your architecture, open a document, whether it's word or Google doc or even an email, you need to write your narrative, don't worry. It's not going to be a novel. It's going to look more like a one-page outline with major points and sub-points to make your case. Then you'll go out and get time on people's calendars. Pick up the phone, get out of your Cube, get out of your office, hop on a video, call need to actively solicit input. Then we'll go in and get our facts and we'll do the heavy lifting analytically will be in sheets. Will be in Excel. Will be in statistical models and pulling a lot of data to really confirm that we're correct with our hypothesis. Then you'll move on to generating your presentation or your final memo or or the final hallway conversation. The end stages of this process are going to be reasonably comfortable, because you probably do a lot of this stuff already, you're comfortable doing the analysis and making some charts and slides, the back it up. The beginning of this process will be very uncomfortable because you're going to be dealing with a lot of ambiguity, it'll be frustrating. At first to say, I don't know what the answer is. But I got to take a guess. It's going to be a new Behavior now. He lied to you. I don't feel bad about it. I need you to understand the process, but I also need you to understand that this is an iterative method. You're going to hit a step, learn something new, and go back to a prior step, and then learn something else. New and go back to a prior step. You will iterate multiple times as you use this method. Not might iterate, you will now, there are two steps in particular that will cause you to iterate more than others. The first is, when you discover Gus and refine your story. Different people have different opinions. So what we tend to do is we say, well, I'm not going to share my idea until it's all buttoned up and I had everything figured out that can be a mistake. Imagine you go through the entire process of coming up with your recommendation. You do a ton of analysis, put it back together and then you share it for the first time with some stakeholders and their responses. Hey, yet answered the wrong question, it's a really long path. From the end when you have a final presentation all the way back to the beginning, to recast the question. So we're going to move this step up earlier in the process. I want you getting input from people before you do the analytical heavy lifting. The other reason we do this a lot earlier in the process is your building buy-in. By the time, people get to the final presentation. Everybody should have had an opportunity to comment on your idea and provide input. When you get to that final meeting, the response should be. Oh yeah. I've seen this. I'm good with it. And you've already addressed my concerns and the only reason we have the meeting is so everybody else can hear that. Everybody's concerns are addressed that's how we get to. Yes, on that first meeting, the second place are going to iterate. A lot is when you prove or disprove your hypothesis. The data doesn't always do what you want the data to do and sometimes you think the graph is going to go up and you do the analysis and went down, you're going to have to go back. Back and recast your story or maybe pick a different hypothesis to pursue. The good news is with every turn of the crank and every iteration, you're getting closer to a more precise, recommendation and you're building stakeholder support along the way, let me walk you through an example of what this method looks like. So let's say we start with the question of what should we do to increase sales? That's the question. That's really broad. Well, I've already carved off half the world. We're going to look at sales, which means we're not going to look at Cost. Am I having it brought during the early stages? It leaves a lot of room for us to look at a lot of different possibilities. As far as hypotheses cup, we could look at pricing new products, new geographies, to enter into, even mergers and acquisitions. Also, we understand what's important to our stakeholder. We're going to come back to them with a way to increase sales and if their objective and key, result is driving the Top Line. When you tell them, I have an idea, and here's how it'll drive the Top Line, they're going to be supportive of what you're going after. Next, we need to generate our core idea. Our initial hypothesis, that core idea is a recommendation plus a reason for doing it. So in this example of trying to drive sales, our initial hypothesis is well, we should sell our products in the north because it's worth five million to 100 million dollars. That's the answer go north, five million to 100 million. May feel a little bit uncomfortable with that, for several reasons. First, I'm going to ask you. To make a really big shift and how you solve problems today. What a lot of people do is they do parallel problem solving. So they have north and south and east and west, and they do the analysis and do the analysis and do the analysis, and then they get to the end of all their analysis in all the areas, and they say, oh that's the best answer with this method. You're going to go from parallel problem solving to serial problem-solving, you're going to have an initial hypothesis that your best guess and you'll prove it. Disprove it, if you prove it, you capture the value, then you can look at the next idea. I'm an Axe and the next, if you disprove it, well, then you can look at the next idea and the next, and the next. Now, there's an important implication in terms of efficiency, let's say that each of these four ideas would take you ten hours. Well, you just spent 40 hours and you got to the best answer with this method of doing it in cereal. You have a best guess and you prove its right? Well you just save 30 hours. Yes. Oh well, maybe you disproved it fine. You say 20 hours, you save 10 at worst. You're going to be even doing it in serial and parallel. So, there is some time savings here. Next, I know somebody is thinking right now. Well, how do you know that going north is the best answer? I don't, I know it's a good answer. This is where a pragmatic business Mike is coming into the conversation. I want teams that have impact and while you're sitting there doing analysis and more and more analysis, yes, you're not having an impact on the business. I would much rather have a team that says, we think this is the right answer. Let's pursue it. Let's execute it. And then we can move to the next idea and the next, and the next. Yeah, sometimes resources are limited and you can't pursue a lot of different ideas. That's fine. So let's say we have 10 ideas finally know, five or small. Let's not look at them. And then try to winnow this down as fast as we can to. The one idea that is going to be the best one. So there's a lot of efficiency in the method, it just requires a bit of a different mindset for how you tackle ideas. Now, another part of the core idea is the impact and here I think going north is worth between 5 million and 100 million. Not so really big range. Sure. But at this stage, it's enough for me to say I'm interested. I'm going to keep going. What if I told you the idea was five thousand to a hundred thousand? Are you as excited? Would you even go to the next step? You would kill this? Idea immediately. So even in a preliminary back-of-the-envelope calculation, early in the process can help you win a down the ideas that you think about pursuing, once you have that idea you need to start structuring your argument. Well why should we go north? Well, I think the markets growing, I think customers, there are price insensitive and I think we don't have a lot of competition for a, pretty good reasons to go north. Now, where did I get those their hypotheses at this stage? I made them up. Now it could be based on my existing knowledge, maybe I've been in the business for 15 years and I know the market. I know customers. And I know those reasons are probably true. It could be that and brand new to the organization on them. Taking a guess. At this point, that's fine. We'll get the facts later on to really confirm or deny these hypotheses. Once I have my argument laid out, I then turn it into a very simple story and start sharing that story with key stakeholders. Hours and I go down the hall to Susan. I say hey Susan I'm thinking about going north to drive sales. What do you think? Well Mike the economy in the midwest is kind of tough right now so you want to look in the Northeast. Oh yeah, you're right. Thank you and I go talk to Bill. Hey Bill, I'm thinking about going into the Northeast. What do you think? I don't know. Might these couple of state's regulatory environment is really tough. You want to look a little further north, maybe up in New England, okay? Thanks and I go from going north to going to New England and I go from Five million to 100 million down to 10 to 30 million. Then I start doing analysis Market by market competitor, by competitor product, by product, and I further narrow, and further narrow and end up with a really precise recommendation of we should enter these three states because it's worth 12 to 18 million dollars of incremental Revenue. Now I started out with go north really Broad and as I move through the process I get more clarity and I get more input and end up with a really precise answer. You'll be comfortable. Cool. With that Precision. At the end, what I need you to get comfortable with is the ambiguity at the beginning, fully recognizing that your story will change as you get more input along the way. So now that you have an overview of how the process works. Let's dive in and look at each step in detail."

Thought process is defining the question and this has two components. What's the issue? And why does the stakeholder care? A lot of times we get the what without the why watch what happens when I give you the? What without the why let's say you're on my team? And I come to the team and say hey team, I need your best idea for an incremental million dollars profit. I have another meeting I gotta go goodbye. Now, if you took a minute and wrote down a bunch of ideas where you would get me that profit, you may come up with things like well we could launch a new product or enter a new geography. Maybe we could do an acquisition or maybe raise prices or try and cut costs somewhere and you go out and spend a few days coming up with your idea. You come back to me and say hey Mike I found your million dollars. What we're going to do is expand into New Market and start selling our products there and after six months we'll have a foothold and after A year we'll have your million dollars. Isn't that great? And my reaction may be no not really. I mean why are we going to do that? Here's the thing. You didn't have the second component which is the why do I care? If instead, I give you a question that was hey team, I need your best idea for an incremental million dollars of profit because the quarter closes in three weeks and we have a shortfall, we have to make up. Now, look at your idea in the context of my need. It's no wonder that. I wasn't supportive of a project that doesn't launch her six months. But here's the thing, it's not your fault. It's mine. I gave you the what without the why? Now there are some implications here. So, if you have a stakeholder, come to you with a, what without a, why ask them why get clarity on what their objective is. If you're the person doing the asking, tell them why don't just do the dry by of the team. And say need a million dollars. Later you have to give them Clarity on what the objective function is. The reason you need to be disciplined about. The finding the question is it helps focus on the most meaningful issues? It's going to help. You generate a case that resonates for that stakeholder because you understand their objective and it avoids wasted effort. Imagine in this example if you went and spent three weeks on an awesome Market entry and product launch plan. Totally wasted effort, but again, not your fault mine. And when we write the question down, this method is a discipline. We write the question down, it starts driving Clarity on what we're trying to prove. So we may have a question of, how do we decrease costs in order to drive profitability? It's clear. What we're looking at, we're looking at costs, not at Revenue, not at new products or Market expansion. We're going to cut costs, and these stakeholders objective is driving profitability. So you'll have to show how much of that money is going to drop to the bottom line. Let's look at a couple more examples of questions that could be written down and some various situations. So, let's say we've got a situation where we've got profitability is declining because costs are rising. And we have to get our costs down in order to remain profitable. We may have a question that's about how can we decrease costs in order to maintain and increase our profitability? And I bet that sounded a little bit weird, maintain an increase. This, the reason we write the question down, if you had that question, put in front of you, you may say, hey, this makes sense to me, except this maintain an increase thing. What do you mean by that? Oh, what I meant was maintained this year and increase next year. Look, I know what I meant. I have the context, but if I'm your stakeholder and I put that in front of you, you don't have the same context as me by writing the question down. We get clarity on We're really trying to answer. Let's look at another example. Let's say our service quality is declining because we have morale issues and we have to solve this because as service quality declines, it's harder to win and keep customers, which is impacting our Revenue. So, we write a question down that states, how can we improve service quality by driving morale in order to drive Revenue? So, it's clear the Box. We want to look in. It's about morale and service quality. And we're going to try and drive the Top Line having Clarity on. The question is going to get you to focus on the right set of issues and make sure you come back to that stakeholder with a recommendation that resonates for them."

Thought process is a lot of fun because it's about ideas, we're going to generate what we call the core idea to do this. We're going to be hypothesis-driven, a hypothesis, is something taken to be true for the sake of argument, right. Now, we don't have any facts or data, so we're going to make some assumptions around. What the answer is knowing that we're going to prove it later on the reason to be hypothesis-driven is it helps you drive to an answer? Quickly. Remember, we're moving from moving in parallel for our problem-solving to moving in cereal and we're going to pick that initial hypothesis that we think is the right answer having a hypothesis. Also helps us come up with a clear recommendation. We have Precision around what the action is that we want to take it helps us identify the facts, we need and the facts. We don't, if my initial hypothesis is go north, I'm not going to do analysis on the Market later on it's going to focus. My analytical efforts. It's going to let me know what I really need to be able to prove my case and eliminate extraneous information. Now, how do we generate these hypotheses? Well, we go back to the question from the last step this method Builds on itself. And then it's classic brainstorming, get everybody together and start generating some ideas to rules. I'll encourage you to apply during brainstorming His first, there's no judgement of ideas. Now, a lot of times people will say, the first rule of brainstorming is there's no bad ideas. Let's be clear. There are bad ideas. We're just not saying it yet. I prefer to think of it as there's no judgement of ideas. Yet the second rule you should put in place. Is your brainstorming is time-bound after Friday, no more ideas. We got to move forward with something. So you generate a bunch of ideas. Then the important part of the structure thought process is you pick One of those ideas to start Mike. How can I pick just one? They're all such great ideas because they're my ideas. Well, which one seems the biggest which one is the team most excited about which one. Do you think your stakeholders going to like the best, which one is on strategy for the organization? We have to pick one. This is where you're making that move from moving in parallel to moving in cereal and saying, I think this is the best idea full. Well, knowing that you made Just prove it and then you can pursue another idea after that. Now once we've chosen our idea, we have an ongoing hypothesis, you then need to turn it into a core idea of core ideas, an elevator pitch and not the elevator pitch, like when you're in job search mode and tell me about yourself, but the elevator pitch of if you get on an elevator with a senior executive and they say, what are you working on? You need to be able to get your recommendation cross quickly and clearly, the core idea has two components. What should we do? And why We do it that y should be your stakeholders button, their objective function, the metric that they care about almost to the exclusion of all others. For example, when I worked in the credit card industry, I had a senior stakeholder who cared about nothing but reducing losses. How much money do we loan out that we don't collect back every time. I went to him with a recommendation, I walked out of his office with a check half million dollars quarter million dollars million dollars. Is not for me, I wouldn't be doing this right now but I walked out with approval, for my recommendations. I had a colleague who would go in and Pitch ideas as well? He never got approval. All the he ever got was sad trombone. Just want one, he never got the money. He asked me one day is like, how do you always get him to give you money easy? I saw the man loss reduction. I knew what his button was, I knew what his key result was and what I was doing was saying, here's my Idea. And here is how it's going to drive your objective function. Now, my colleague was going in and pitching ideas and saying, hey, we should do this because it drives revenue, or profit, or cost reduction or morale, All Good Things, none of which that senior stakeholder cared about. You need to have that Clarity on what the stakeholders objective function is in order to make your case resonate. When you write your core idea, I want you to write it in this sequence. What should we do? And why should we do it? A lot of times people will flip that around and the want to hang that button out there. First to get people's attention, they think I got a big pile of money and I'm going to get everybody excited, you run the risk of losing control of the conversation. When you do that, I had one colleague, who went to the executive committee who met every month, and he had an idea for improving the supply chain, so walks in the room. And he switched the core idea, and he put the button out there first he said, hey, folks. Today we're here to talk about a five million dollar profit opportunity and he was quiet for dramatic effect and The Branding person was in the room and they said oh cool branding campaign. Well no no no I want to talk about supply chain. Now you want to talk branding? Yeah let's hook branding. We had a one-hour branding meeting. This poor guy walked out of the room saying we didn't even get to talk about my idea. Yeah, because you hung the button out there first and you Excited and your audience went in the direction that you didn't expect the reason right. Your core idea in this sequence is you're taking advantage of the way. People already think, people think in terms of cause and effect, give them cause and effect. If I come to you and say we should consolidate our supply base and reduce the number of suppliers we use, you have one question in your mind why? Well, because it's worth a million dollars. Give them cause and effect. Act. Now, I know you may be thinking, well, this is great, but sometimes I have multiple stakeholders and they have different buttons in different objective functions. That means I would have to write multiple core ideas. Yeah, exactly. Your marketing ideas each stakeholder? You're pitching to is a different market segments, with different objectives. So when you're going to write your core idea, you take a step back and say well what's my hypothesis? What is my best guess then you stop and think about that. Older identify their button. What is that objective function? They have, and then tie, your idea to their objective function at this stage of the process. You can even write in X, you don't need numbers. You don't even need a range of numbers, but I do encourage you to write x x dollars X percent. It's a placeholder and you'll solve for it later on. Now, you can generate core ideas for any level of recommendation. I know I throw around things like mergers and Acquisitions or millions of dollars of opportunity and those are pretty big. You might say well I don't deal with things like that and those are not the types of recommendations I'd make, that's okay. You can use this process for any level of recommendation from things that are really big. Like, we should expand into Asia, to double the size of the company in terms of revenue and profit all the way down to, we should remove. Move these three steps from our process to get 12 to 16 percent more efficient I can use core ideas with my kids, my son Michael. Hey Michael go clean your room right? Take your Xbox, very clear recommendation, very powerful button. Now, you have to have the button, right? The first time I tried that, I said clean your room or I'll take the we well, whatever. Okay, clean your room, right? Take the Xbox. No, I want to play Call of Duty, okay? I found the button. You got to make sure you have a button that resonates for For that stakeholder. So take the time, right? That clear core idea. What's the action? What's the result? And that result being your stakeholders button, this will drive Clarity for the rest of the construction of your recommendation."

If not go ahead and hit pause, and go back and do the exercise come back when you're done. Okay. Now that you've done the exercise, what did you get? Did you get groups of Poker and animals or maybe Golf and football? Some of you may be saying, well, that's not fair. I'm not from the US and I don't know about American football or hey, I'm not a poker fan and I never would have come up with that. Okay. Well, you could have come up with other groups, maybe it's long words, and short words, monosyllabic and polysyllabic begins with a vowel begins with a consonant. Even number of letters, odd, number letters. Look, all I did was give you raw, unstructured data. I gave you chaos. We don't like chaos. So we put order to the chaos and the way we order the cows is based on our perspective, here's the problem. Your perspective is not necessarily my perspective. Let's say I'm here today to talk to you about poker and animals and why they're so great. And I just give you that raw unstructured data and you go all Golf and football on me. Now, I got a problem actually had two problems. To get you off of golf and football, which is hard because it's right, because you came up with it and I got to get you onto poker and animals. Let's imagine I give you different instructions for that exercise. And the instructions were please arrange these ideas into groups of Poker and animals. I've given you the structure now, I'll bet you would end up with an answer that looks just like the one I want you to come up with and even if you didn't know what a term was. And you say, well I've never heard of a rake. What is that? You can use process of elimination to say, well, I'm pretty sure it's not an animal. So it must be a poker term. This is the fundamental premise of architecture. Architecture is the arrangement of thoughts and ideas into logical groups. So the audience arrives at your conclusion, not their own Now, there are a few principles of architecture first. There will be a hierarchy of thought logic, will build upon logic will build upon logic. Next, it's always three things. Three groupings. Usually three sometimes, two, sometimes, four or five, but no more than five because the human brain can only absorb so much information at a given time. And if you throw 10 groups at me, I might get overwhelmed. So this about synthesizing thoughts into a manageable number of buckets. Last once you build an architecture, you need to make sure your thoughts are distinct and complete and I'll walk through what that looks like. Let's look at the two primary architectures that you can use the first is what I call a layer approach in a layer approach. We have some background to give context. Then we talk about something is changed, good or bad. And then there's our core idea from the last step. There's also a column approach in a column approach. We have our core idea and three reasons, we I'd do it were three supporting points for going after that recommendation. Now you may be wondering, well when do I use? Which one? We use a layer approach when our audience isn't grounded, they don't have contacts. So we need to ground them first, then create a case for Action. Then, our core idea has contacts, and it makes sense. We use a column approach when the audience knows the deal and they just want the answer a lot of times. This is your manager or stakeholder, you present to all the time. Let me walk through a real quick example here. So let's say I have a recommendation Of, we should buy a new dialer from vendor a because it'll reduce losses by ten million dollars a year. Now, I'm betting, most of you watching this have never worked in the credit card. Space, let alone in the collection space. So you have no idea what I'm talking about. I would need to use a layer architecture to convey my case. So let's start with some background in the credit card industry. We low money to Consumers based on how risky they are, and they don't always pay us back. And when they don't pay us back, we Pursue collections activities and we use a technology called the dialer to tell us who to call. And when to call them what phone number to call them on. So now you're grounded, what's changed, is the economy has been kind of tough and our loss has been going up. And our dialer is really old and it keeps breaking down, and we can't perform our collections activities. Therefore, we should core idea by a new dialer from vendor a because it'll reduce our losses by ten million dollars a year. So, I grounded you on Way the industry works and how we do business, talk about some dynamics that are forcing us to change Rising losses and old technology. And then I gave you a recommendation that makes sense in that context. Now let's imagine instead of me pitching, the idea of to you, I'm pitching it to my EDP at the credit card company and she's been in the industry for 15 years now. Watch what happens when I go to her with the wrong architecture. I walk in. And I say, well in the credit. Card industry. We low money to Consumers based on how risky they are. Oh my gosh, get out of my office. Why are you telling me stuff? I already know. I shouldn't be using a layer approach there. I need to go in with a column in that situation. I'll go in with my core idea. First, we should buy new dialer from this vendor because it'll reduce losses by ten million dollars a year. And then I get straight into my supporting points. I'll talk about the dialer and the reasons we need a new one. I'll talk about why I want to use this particular vendor and then Talk about financial impacts of making this decision. So I'm in I give my stakeholder what they need and I'm out. Now, the principle of logic building upon logic building upon logic applies. As you construct the architecture and you can combine layer approaches and column approaches. When you build your architecture, build from the top down and later will prove from the bottom up, what I mean by that is let's say I'm going with this dialer example still. And I have a column approach for my particular audience. Well, my core idea is I should buy a new dialer from this vendor because it reduces losses by 10 million dollars a year. Well, there are my columns I need to talk about the dialer, the vendor and the loss reduction. So now I've got my columns. I worked from that core idea, down to the next level. Now, let's imagine for this particular recommendation, I'm going to be pitching the idea to the CIO, so they know a lot about technology when I go to talk about the dialer and why we need a new one, I'll use a column approach to explain that piece because the CIO is grounded, they know the technology and understand it. Very well, when I go talk to the CIO about the technology vendors, the ones that they're intimately familiar with. I'll also use a column and I may talk about vendor A b and c. Now, when I start talking about loss rates and financial impacts to the CIO and about the way things flow and collections, they may not be too familiar with those Concepts. So I'll need to use a layer approach to explain that. And here's how lawsuits work. And here's why they've been going up and here's what the impact would be of a new dialer. So depending on the audience, you're going to combine these different architectures and just work from the top down. Think about who your audience is. And structure the argument in a way that they'll best understand it. Once you've built your architecture, you do need to pressure test it for Quality. First, is looking at your thoughts to make sure they're distinct? This is trying to eliminate overlaps in your ideas. So, let's say, I had a column approach and I said, well, profits would increase and costs would decrease and productivity would increase. Well, those sort of bleed over. So if Costco down, will profit, would go up. And I'm not sure which column we're talking about here and where This particular idea goes thoughts, aren't distinct. It's hard to understand make your thoughts distinct from talking about Revenant and costs and morale those are distinct Concepts. Now, they're related and they touch one another, but I created a meaningful amount of separation between them. Second. You need to make sure your thoughts are complete. No gaps in your logic. So as I look at that core idea, I need to make sure every element that's included in that core idea. Has support somewhere below this notion of distinct and complete. Also applies to layer approaches. You should talk about your background and everything that maybe happened in the past. And then what's changed is everything that's happening now or that we forecast to happen in the future and those are distinct. Shep's. The reason to make your thoughts distinct and complete is, it's easier to understand the argument. It's easier to remember it, and it's easier to approve it. It also makes sure that you don't have any gaps in your logic. That could make your argument crumble when you pitch your idea. So let's look at that, dialer, and vendor and money. Example, if I have a column approach, I'm talking about the dialer and the technology I'm talking about people who sell the technology as vendors and I'm talking about the financial impacts, those are Concepts and it's complete my core ideas. We should buy a new dealer, I got support for that from this vendor got support for that and it'll have this financial impact and I've got support for that. Sometimes, this is referred to as being Niecy mutually exclusive collectively, exhaustive that's fancy talk for distinct and complete. Now, the benefits of architecture are many architecture is really hard to do. You're going to struggle with this initially and have to put a lot of effort into it. But I promised the effort is worth it, because architecture is going to drive everything after this and the structure thought process, some of the benefits of architecture are in a presentation. This is how that presentation goes from 80 Pages down to 10. Architecture tells you exactly what information you need to include and what you can exclude, it, right? Business cases architecture will make that business case easier to understand. If you structure your argument. Architects replies to emails and voicemails. We've all gotten that long rambling voicemail where it's like, I don't know where this person is going and it just goes on and on and on architecture can tighten that communication up or those emails that are just the long text bricks that go on and on and on and you have to scroll forever to get to the point. Architecture can tighten those up to the biggest benefit of Architecture. Is it tells you what information you need and What information? You don't, this is where analysis goes away. This is going to save you time. So when you go to build your architecture, take your core idea from the last step, assess your audience decide whether they need a layer approach or column approach, and go ahead and diagram. The architecture out, grab a whiteboard, draw it in front of you. So you can see if there's any overlaps or if there are any gaps in your logic. Because once you have this architecture complete, it will drive Everything else in the structured thought process."

First, I'd like you to look at a couple of business cases for me. So, here are two business cases. Which one would you approve? Which one would you fund? You probably jump pretty quickly to business case, be why? Well, it's structured. You can get to the information pretty quickly, right off the bat. You see, there are economic customer and Associate benefits to Suing this idea, the first line says, it's worth 10 million dollars. Now, I'm playing a game. Look at these two business cases. What do you notice about the information? It's all the same, it's exactly the same information. The first one is nothing but just a data dump. Here's everything that I know. There's no structure to it. The second business case, took more time to write. I had to take a step back and think about how am I going to structure this information and put it in meaningful buckets, but when I put that second business case in front of a stakeholder and they see oh ten million dollars and customers and Associates will love it. They're ready to approve it and they see not first business case, they can get overwhelmed and say oh there's two Dana here. I don't want to deal with it so putting architecture to your business cases. Makes them more memorable and easier to access. Architecture works with emails to take a look at these two emails, and you've probably gotten both flavors of them. That first one is just the stream of Consciousness. Yes, there's a lot of good information in there but there's also some irrelevant stuff. Oh the color scheme is really cool. It's this new Sea Foam. It's so soothing. I don't care as your stakeholder. I don't care. Why is this information in there? Now look at the second email first few words, I want your approval And here are the reasons why here's the impact in terms of market, share and profitability and we can get it done and get back to me by this date. By this time, with approval, for the idea, the email gets in gets the point across has the supporting points and it gets out. Now, confess I do write emails like the first one. The difference is, I don't hit send when I see myself rambling on and on and on, I'll take a step back and say, hang on a minute. What am I trying to say? How could I Better structure this information. And I may take a step back and say, well, I'm talking about the training course structure and I'm talking about the training course benefits and then I'm talking about training course, Logistics and I'll rearrange the email into those meaningful buckets and it'll look more like an outline than it will a block of pros. And, by the way, there's always some stuff left over, it's not really relevant, I can delete it. It's not important to making that case, emails are a great place to practice. This method. Now, let's look at a couple of examples of architectures that you may build. So, in the first case, let's use a layer approach. My audience is going to be the board of directors, and they're not really grounded on what's going on in the business. So I have to ground them and then create a case for action and then make my recommendation. So, in the background, I talked about our business and where we sell our products. I talked about the way our growth has, flattened a Lil Bit And I talk about what our goals are for the year. Then when I talk about what's changed, I point out I really saturated the markets that were in in the Mid-Atlantic. So I need to expand and I've noticed that the competitor doesn't have a big presence in the Northeast and that may be a great opportunity. Therefore, we should expand into the Northeast to drive profitability. Now, let's look at another example and maybe I'm pitching. The idea to the clo and she's very grounded on what's going on in the business. I need to go in with a column approach. So I make the recommendation of we should expand into the Northeast because we can drive incremental growth and profitability. And then I talk about geography. So why am I talking about going to the Northeast and talk about the markets, where in our saturated but there's an open market in the Northeast. I talked about Service delivery. So we've got the capability to enter these new markets, and can hire staff and get things up and running pretty quickly. And last, I talked about economics, here are the economic impacts of entering that new market. Now, you'll notice I have the same core idea in both situations, but different architectures. And the point is I have different audiences. You will need to write different architectures for those different audiences to give them exactly the information that they need. Let's look at another example, that's not necessarily financially driven because whatever the button is you can use this method. You're driving toward an objective that the stakeholder cares about. So let's say we work for a document Processing Company and we process a lot of items every month and our key metrics of cycle times and error rates have been acceptable in the past and we haven't looked at this area in a long time. In terms of performance what's changed is recently our cycle time. An error rates have been trending in the wrong direction and the forecast for volume. This year is explosive. So we're doing worse and we're going to have to do more work, that's pretty terrifying. But we've done a diagnostic from a lean manufacturing perspective and we think we can get a lot more efficient in this area. Therefore we should apply lean manufacturing principles to this process because it can reduce cycle times and error rates by x + y % +. Yeah, I push two buttons there you can I'm push up to three buttons, not too many because it gets overwhelming but one, two, maybe three buttons of the most important metrics. Again I set contacts with the background, talk about what's change and then I present a core idea that has a clear action to take with buttons that resonate for the stakeholder. Take some time and think about something you're working on. Think about one, stakeholder, you're pitching. The idea to create that core idea. And build an architecture, that is targeted at that individual You only want to give them the information, they really need in order to make a decision."

The first thing your architecture is going to drive is your story. Your story is a long hand draft of your argument. It's a draft, it's going to change, you'll write complete sentences and you're going to write it out more as an outline than block Pros. I encourage you to open a document or maybe an email to draft this story, some guiding principles for writing it First, don't polish dirt. You shouldn't be wordsmithing at this stage. If you're agonizing over, whether you should say significantly or substantially, just say a lot and move on with life. Why, what might change. When you do the analysis later on, you thought it was going to be a lot and it ended up not being a lot and all that time. You spent wordsmithing is now wasted effort. Keep your story, simple. You're not Ernest Hemingway. You're not writing the next. This work of literature, the simpler it is the easier. It's going to be to understand for your audience and you want to use your architecture to drive the structure of this story. Let's take a look at a story. Here's an example story. Our business is performing. Well, we have this many customers, this much revenue, this much profit we're doing. Okay, but there's an opportunity to grow one of our biggest competitors. Ders is having some financial difficulties core idea. Therefore, we should purchase our competitor because it'll dry this financial impact. And here are some supporting points. Why? When you write your story, I want you thinking of it like a kids book, See Spot Run Spot, run fast, spot makes money, the simpler, it is the easier, it is to understand. Let's look at how you construct this story. So, if you had a layer approach, what I want you to do is, take that architecture, invert it, and right? So background is in the beginning, then we talk about something happen. Changed. Therefore, we should core idea. The layer approach lends itself, very well to this, chronological sequential type of Storytelling and it'll be easy for your audience to follow. Because, remember, we build a layer when they're not grounded. So we're giving them that background up front. Take a look at this layer story. Now, I know it's a slide. Imagine it's in a document. So you're just writing out the flow of the narrative and then in Your core idea. You've got some additional supporting points. Why that core idea is the right answer. Going from column. 2 story is a little bit different. You don't even have to flip it over. You just write the column. Architecture. Starts with the core idea, right up front and then you get into the reasons why you should be pursuing that idea. Now, one important, caveat here, a column doesn't have a connotation of sequence, so when you write that story, you write your core idea. First? Because your audience is grounded. They want to know the answer up front, then you need Decide the sequence of your columns and this example I've got the financial impact first, the reason is my audience is the CFO. They're going to want to hear about the money first. Now if my audience was somebody in human resources, or who is dealing with the employee union, and I went in with this story as written, I might get bad reaction. They may say, oh great, there you go. Again, money's always for some people are always last. Well, no, that's not what I said. Well, that's what you are indicating there by putting things in the right sequence. Based on your audience's perspective, you might get a better reaction. So if I'm talking to human resources or the union, I may put the people piece first and I may move the financials to the end. So I'm going to tailor my approach to my audience, to make sure that they understand what I think is important. Which by the way, is what's important to them. Remember, when you write your story, keep it simple, don't Wordsmith recognize that your story can change. And at this point you're just looking to make it flow. One other thing you probably notice in these stories is I didn't just write background and what's changed or have column headings of economic customer and Associate benefits actually synthesize those points? I'm starting to tell my audience. Here's what I want you to think about the Max, I'm presenting to you starting to shape their opinion. Now it's a fine balance here, you shouldn't be wordsmithing, but you should be thinking about, how are you going to position your ideas? It's a Nuance but this is where the real influence in this method starts coming in. So it's fine to write your story initially and right background, what's changed core idea but then go back and recast that story and think about when my audience is here, I want them over here. How am I going to position? Addition this information in a manner that they'll get to the conclusion. I want them to draw. Take that architecture, write that story as simply as you can step away from it for an hour and come back and read it for flow. And if it flows and you can get from the beginning to the end and get to the conclusion, you have a good draft of an initial story."

Maybe some clothes members of your team, this next step can freak people out because you're going to take your idea out there and start shopping it around. I recognize you have no facts, you have no data. You've done no analysis, this can feel a little bit uncomfortable. So you're going to go out with a draft argument and you're going to start sharing your idea with people and soliciting input. This is how you're going to bulletproof your idea. We're looking for objections, we want to hear the risks and concerns so that we can address them before we get to the final presentation. You may iterate a lot during this stage and go back to Prior steps and refine your architecture or add or subtract things from your story. That's fine. Those are draft documents, they should evolve as you get stakeholder input along the way. So, what is this step all about, get out of your Cube, get out of your office. Pick up the phone. Hop on a video chat and talk with people you're asking for their input. Some principles here that can help with this. Is first put caveat surround the status of your work so they know exactly where you stand what that may sound like is have just started working on this idea. I haven't done any analysis yet. What I'd like is your input and feedback on. Am I heading down the right path? Are there any big things that I might be missing? Does my story makes sense to you. So later on when I do the analysis that I haven't done yet, I make sure I'm addressing your concerns. Not with that setup. That individual expects, that I've done no analysis, they know where I stand in the process, during this step be open to new ideas. People are going to see things differently, they'll highlight issues you haven't thought of so be willing to incorporate those but balance that with your closer to the information than they, maybe you don't have to include everything that they bring up. Along the way, you can take it or leave it if you're the one. Who's going to be delivering the presentation? So who should you talk to here? Well, people tend to think very vertically and Leonard linearly, they'll talk to their team, please talk to your team. They're smarter than you if you're hiring well, and you'll probably talk to your manager and maybe your boss's boss and your boss's boss boss and the ultimate decision-maker. Yep. We're going to get all those people involved. Think broadly could talk to operations and it and finance and HR and legal you need to understand what all the concerns could be for your idea. That's where you can get blindsided and have your idea of blow up in your face. And the most important person to talk to is your Nemesis, this is that person one who's always shooting down your idea or poking holes in your argument. And yeah, sometimes this person is somebody that you have a lot of conflict with, sometimes it's your best friend. And I had a wonderful Nemesis at one point, she and I got along famously and she was a great Nemesis because she looked at things from a different angle than I did. And she thought I saw things that I never would have seen, we have to involve our Nemesis early because we want to know what are their concerns so that we can address those concerns before we get to the final steering committee. Meeting what I see. A lot of times is people avoid that Nemesis because it's an uncomfortable conversation and they avoid them and they avoid them. And then they'll schedule their steering committee meeting when the Nemesis is out on vacation, when they walk into the meeting and there, they are sitting there, right in the front. Oh hey, I thought you were on vacation today. Oh no, I wanted to be here for this. You're in trouble, and what will happen is, you'll pitch your idea and that person is going to look for every way to shoot it down. It's a much better situation. If you go to that person early in the process and say, hey, this is preliminary what Concerns. Do you have? And they'll list off all their concerns. The good news is now you have time to get the right information to address those concerns. So when you do go to the final meeting and that person is in the room and they say, well, have you thought about this? Well, yeah, you and I talked about that before and I've done the analysis and it's not going to be a problem. You're able to satisfy their concerns in front of everybody, and if you can get your idea past your Nemesis, you can get it passed. Anyone So make sure you're thinking broadly about who these stakeholders are. Now this step of the process is not a discrete step, you're going to start syndication now and continue, syndicating your idea as you move through the rest of the method. Some people, I know you can involve until you have all the analysis done, especially your senior decision-maker. But when it's a little bit more nebulous, you can involve your team and maybe your manager and maybe after some preliminary analysis, involve a couple of other stakeholders and after a little more, Rigger. Expand the circle and involve more people. So the closer to you closer, you get to a precise answer. The more people you're going to involve along the way. So questions you should be asking during this step of the process is first, is this idea of big enough to care? Are you excited about it? If your stakeholders aren't excited, you should shut that thing down. Now, ask them what the hurdles are to operationalizing. The idea are their it regulatory, Financial operational, people considerations that we have to think of go to those domain experts and ask them what's on their mind. If we go after this idea, have we looked at this idea in the past, is there existing data out there? You would be surprised that how many times I see, people do redundant analysis where we already knew the answer, but nobody ever bothered to ask what's the decision makers button, what are they care about the most? And how do you make sure that your idea is going to drive their objective function? I had one situation where I took over a program that wasn't doing very well and I needed to put forth a recommendation. So I sat down with my stakeholder who was my boss at first and I said, well what do you want to do? We have two choices. We can fix the program or we can kill it and they said, well I really want to fix it. Okay, great. Why do you want to fix it? Well because I want to drive loss reduction. Okay. Initial core idea is we should fix the program because it will improve losses by X dollars. Ultimately, whatever recommendation I was going to make we needed to make to our EVP. Now I didn't go straight to her with that initial core idea. I went to my team I said, hey team what do you think we should do here? Well, we think we should make these three changes to the program because it'll drive between five and fifteen million dollars of incremental loss Improvement and they did some preliminary analysis and back-of-the-envelope calculations. And it looked like we figured out what was going on. So then we took that idea to my boss's boss and we said, hey here's the recommendation and we think we should make these three changes because it's worth five million to 15 million dollars of loss reduction. And he said, hey, that's great. When you talk to the EBP, she's going to want to see the profit impact. So, losses are sort of secondary here. Oh, that's a great point. We hadn't thought of that. So that's another analysis will need to make sure we do. Then we went to an adjacent division leader and if we did our idea that it was going to impact his business unit and we pitch our idea to him and said, what do you think? And he said well, that's great and I'm supportive of the idea but you need to re forecast my budget because you're going to have an impact on my financials. And we said well you know what no we're not going to do that analysis. Will give you the data so your team can do it. But that's out of scope for us the reason. I was so explicit about that point was, if I didn't bring that up, he may have expected that analysis and when we go to the final recommendation and he says, well, where's my budget? And I say, well we didn't do it. He's going to say, well, we can't make a decision today. So if you're going to scope something out, be explicit with the stakeholder. Why you're doing that now? He said, yeah, you're right, we should do that analysis, not you guys, so just make sure we get the data. Great. So then we went to the direct report of our EVP. Sat down with him for two hours and he probed every last bit of our recommendation after he got done with us. He said, make sure you tell the story in this order and you talk about profit first and then losses. And at the end of the presentation, how much money you need for it? Then we went to our EVP. We had a clear story, we knew what all the stakeholder concerns were going to be that meeting took 20 minutes. She went through the story and said, this makes Since we're talking about profit, that's most important. And yeah we're going to have some loss reduction Improvement as well. Then she went around the table and said well what do you folks think? And every stakeholder we had spoken with said yep I support the idea and we got the business case signed and we were done. Now that was a lot of meetings to have to do that syndication but the thing is you're going to have those meetings anyway either before you meet with the EVP or after and it's a much better outcome. If you have those syndication meetings before you meet with your Senior stakeholder. So take your story. Identify the people who would be impacted, go out and talk with them. Incorporate their feedback into your recommendation as appropriate. It'll help you get your recommendation approved."

Breathe a sigh of relief. Now you get facts but look how much work we've done up to this point before we get a lick of data. You defined a question. You understand why it's important to your stakeholder that you answer it, you identified a core idea which is a hypothesis plus a button that that stakeholder really cares about you structured your argument and the form of an architecture, you turn it into a narrative and got input from others. Stakeholders, but you're still going to need data. A strong case is based on strong facts, what you're going to do is use your architecture to drive your analytical plan. So first, if something is in your architecture, you're going to need support for it. Some points will need a little bit of support. Some are going to need huge analyses to back things up. So some guiding thoughts here first, make sure the The analysis is necessary to proving your case we're trying to eliminate redundant analysis or junk work. That's never going to be seen, get focused on the analysis. You need, make sure you have sufficient analysis. A solid fact base is going to convince your audience and don't just tell people what data you want. Tell them what you're trying to do with it. They may have better data sources. They can provide you that will make your argument that much stronger. If you remember earlier, I said, architecture drives everything architecture. Drives your story architecture, is also going to drive the analysis, you do and the analysis. You don't remember, we build from the top down and we proved from the bottom up, part of that is saying I've got a core idea and here's the logic for how I'm going to prove it that logic is going to dictate the individual analyses. You need to back that case up. Imagine you had that core idea of buying a new dialer from the vendor, and it's going to save you a certain amount of money. And if I have those three columns of dialer and vendor and money, I need the analysis to support it. So, for the dialer, I may do analysis around the performance of our current dialer and the capabilities of new ones to prove that a new dialer, would fix the challenges. I'm having in terms of vendors, I may do the analysis on multiple vendors and Show what their strengths are how their product performs and maybe what their pricing is for getting that new dialer in the door. And last on losses, I'll show our current loss Trends and potentially future losses and how they'll be reduced with an improved dialer. My analyses are derived directly from the architecture. Sure, there are hundreds of other analyses. I could do. The thing is, I don't need to do them. They're not relevant to proving this. Case. So the core idea, dictates the architecture, the architecture, dictates the analysis and will do the analysis and prove our architecture from the bottom up. The point is be focused in the analysis, you do and let the architecture dictate if somebody who you're talking to during the syndication process as well. What about this analysis? And this one, and this one, make sure the analysis is relevant to the case, you're making the argument. Texture actually provides you a way to push back on people, when they suggest they're relevant analysis, you can pull the architecture out and say, well, this is the logic that we agreed to. So help me understand how the analysis you're asking for fits into this structure and when they see that the analysis doesn't fit, then you probably don't need to do. It architecture is going to not only help you get your idea approved because you have a sound logical argument. It's also going to help you to avoid wasted effort."

You need to be prepared to have your hypothesis disproven a solid set of facts and a solid set of analyses that prove all the hypotheses in your architecture. Go a long way toward making your case, but this is a hypothesis driven approach the hypothesis may not be accurate. So, first be open to disproving a Jesus, you're not wrong. It's actually a source of innovation, hypotheses are based on gut instinct. The conventional wisdom will. You've learned something new everybody believes one thing now, you know, something else you can take different action. If you're not sure, if your analysis is convincing, go ask your Nemesis. They'll tell you if they're convinced by the analysis. So let's look at an example of proving and disproving hypotheses. And the Nations thereof. So if you remember, we had the emergency room with the screening processes and some of the challenges they were facing there. And when we look at the issues that they're facing, we said in terms of associate morale that there are a few issues that better screening would solve for first, we said our Associates will have higher morale if they treat more patients, that's why they're in healthcare, they like helping people. Well, we do the analysis and we find out well look the more Patients. We see the more morale increases so that one's proven. We also said that most of the complaints that they're getting is because of wait, time. Well we do the analysis. And it looks like the biggest source of complaints is indeed. Wait, time, finally, we said that Physicians are unhappy because when patients come back for their appointment, they're complaining a lot about wait time and we went out and spoke to several positions. And wouldn't, you know, it? Most of the quotes came back that the real issue is wait time. So it looks like all the points in that particular column are proven and our case is going to hold, let's look at what happens when we disprove something in the architecture. So we were looking at the economics and how many patients we would see and what the revenue would be from that? And we said if we have shorter, wait times, we'll see more patients and longer. Wait times result, in fewer patients, well that analysis is proven pretty convincingly. We also hypothesize that emergency room patients are worth about $200 of incremental contribution a piece and that analysis is pretty clear that there are two hundred dollars person. The last hypothesis we had was that if patients are more satisfied, will have higher retention. When we do the analysis, there's no slope there. The curve is flat. Well, that doesn't really make a lot of sense, so you're telling me if they're less satisfied, they're still going to stick around. What you have to do, when you disprove an element of your architecture is take a step back and say, well, why is this happening and you stop and think about it. It's the emergency room whether you smile at them or not, when they're checking in, they're not going to leave. They don't have other options to potentially drive across town. This is a real emergency. So what we have to do is go back to our architecture and we asked well even though we don't get a retention benefit from a better screening process and shorter wait times. Is it still a good idea to try to reduce? Wait times? And the answer is absolutely, we'll see more patients and will realize incremental contribution from those patients, we would save that one analysis where we disproved the retention effect. We put it in an appendix in case, somebody asks about it but overall our argument seems to pretty much hold - that one piece of information. So sometimes disproving hypotheses will just have a small effect on the overall story sometimes though. You're going to do your analysis and find out the entire story changes. I personally went through this when I was a consultant we were serving a North American commodity chemical manufacturer and they had some small European presence but were mostly in North America, the CEO and a division president found out that their biggest competitor was going to sell their European business. The division president wanted to buy it because it would double the size of his business unit. The CEO, however, wasn't too keen on doing The deal and he brought us in and said, I don't want to buy the European business, so go ahead and prove it. Okay. So we generated an initial core idea of we should not by the European business because you can't get scale. So there's no pricing power and no synergies from a cost-saving standpoint. The logistics won't work. We believe they have their Logistics Network. We have ours and they're not really complementary and customers won't care. Current customers won't care if we're bigger in Europe and prospective customers won't care either. So buying the European business looks like a bad idea. Those were our in going hypotheses, then we did the analysis and the analysis showed. If we bought the European business, we could raise prices worldwide by ten percent. That's a huge number in a commodity industry. And by the way we found out, our client was much more efficient than the competitor was in Europe. And they could take out about ten million dollars a year in cost savings synergies but still, you know, the logistics. I work and customers wouldn't care. So, we looked at Logistics and we found that the competitors European Logistics network was almost a perfect match in very complementary to our clients. So, it looks like the logistics did work but still customers wouldn't care. So, we went out and spoke with customers. We found out that current customers were saying, wow. If you can serve me in Europe, I'd give you my European business and even more in North America. And prospective customers said, well, the reason I don't use Was a suppliers. You can't Supply me in Europe, if you can supply me in Europe. I'll give you Europe and North America. That core idea. Very quickly became we should buy the European assets because we can get scale, the logistics do work and customers do care. This was one of the most interesting engagements I was ever on because I didn't really understand proving and disproving hypotheses from a recommendation standpoint until I went through this We went to the CEO when we said, we know, we said initially that we didn't think it was a good idea, but we've done the analysis and we've actually proven the case that you should pursue this acquisition, to the CEOs credit, about six weeks later, they announced a 250 million dollar bid for this business. The moral of the story is when you disprove things, it doesn't mean that the opportunity is gone. It just means that you may need to pursue another opportunity. So the next time you're doing analysis and it doesn't go the way you think. It's going to take that step back, say, what are the implications for my recommendation and what new ideas come out of it? Because with that solid fact base, even if it wasn't what you originally expected, those solid facts can lead you to a great new conclusion."
eda9f4e2-34fb-11f0-b608-fa0a240152c3,Thought Leaders,2025-05-19T14:55:07.725998,Lesson 11 Finalize Communication,https://storage.mtls.cloud.google.com/maylyan-rag/20200517%20STC%20Lesson%2011%20Finalize%20Communication.mp4,gs://maylyan-rag/20200517 STC Lesson 11 Finalize Communication.mp4,"Now that you've proven all the points in your architecture, it's time to finalize. Your communication. This final communication is going to be the synthesis of all the analysis. You did a couple of things to keep in mind. First more is not better. You're not impressing me. When you come to me with an 80-page presentation, essentially, what you're saying is I have a bunch of stuff. Not really sure what's important to you. So here you figure it out. You want me to To do your job. That's what your stakeholders thinking. More is not better, have a concise presentation or memo. It's about focusing on what's most important to that stakeholder also communicate with them in their preferred medium. If somebody wants a presentation, build a presentation, they want a memo. Give them a memo. They want to have a conversation, stop by their office. If somebody likes presentations and you give them a dense memo, they're not going to engage with it. It's not about what's comfortable for you. It's about what's comfortable for them. So, the two, most common vehicles that I see people making recommendations in or emails /, voicemails and presentations in an e-mail or voicemail. It's really pointed, and really short, you have a greeting, and you give them a little bit of background on what the issue is. You don't have to. Deep them and all the history of the issue, but just let them know. Hey, here's the topic that this message is about, let them know what the recommendation is and any timeline for Action. So you get in make your point and you get out. If you find yourself Rambling On and On or you get the warning from the voicemail person saying you have 10 seconds, remaining to leave your message or you find yourself, having to scroll on the email to get through it, all, you're using the wrong communication vehicle, you have too much stuff, Tough into smaller package emails and voicemails are quick in point and out. Now, the presentation is a more common vehicle for making a recommendation. If you follow this method rigorously, you've already built your presentation, you just didn't know it. So the presentation should start with a title page, then you'll get into your executive summary, which is going to be the whole story on a single slide. Then you'll get into the data to support your case. And then have some thoughts on risks and opportunities. This isn't the massive risk plan, its top, three or four risks and top three or four opportunities then a sense for what, the next steps will be. Again this is not the big project plan, it's four or five major milestones and then you may have an appendix which by the way, you should not distribute because you're just asking for trouble. If you give somebody a nice tight 10-page, presentation with a 40-page appendix, I guarantee you will be on page 30 of the appendix before, you know, It the appendix is there to answer any questions they may have, if they don't have questions, you don't need to go to the appendix. So let's work our way through a typical presentation. So congratulations, you're an author. You've been published and your book comes out tomorrow. You pop on down to the bookstore because you want to check out the competition. And these books are on the Shelf when you pick any of them up to, any of them? Look interesting. Yeah, I know some of them are Ryan. I can't help myself. But there's something on those covers to draw you in like cell in Big Red Letters. Or this one's about Green Berets or what's up with the paper plane. There's something there to catch your attention. Now your book comes out, there it is, it's called book by you. White cover, black aerial lettering. That's what it is compared to those other offerings. How do you think book is gonna do not so good? Right? Here's the corollary. Take a look at the last five. Isn't ations you've written as the title, something like blank update or blank overview. Book by you, think about how many presentations are going across your stakeholders desk every week and you know what they're doing triage book book, book book. You're not going to read them but they'll read something that says redesigning complaint handling. A thirty five million dollar opportunity. Now if the title was something like new complaint process, no one will ever read that anything with complaint and process as two-thirds of the title. Oh my gosh, I can't imagine opening that. But when I see redesigning complaint handling a 35 million dollar opportunity, I'm interested. Now this title May remind you of a prior step in the process. It's your core idea right there on the first page you're telling the stakeholder. Here's what I want to do and here is what's in it for you. You're pushing their button on page. One that gets them to go to page to page. Two is going to be your executive Of summary. Your executive summary is the whole story on a single page. It can't say continued. It can't say one of seven. That's not a summary. That's a Manifesto. You're trying to get your point across clearly. And concisely, when you write the executive summary, I'm going to get really tactical here and tell you to make the letters between 16 and 18, pitch less than 16 is a little too dense. The letters are too small and bigger than 18 is a little bit insulting. It looks like a kids book. 16:18 will give you a nice balance of content on the page and that executive summary is going to be your table of contents point. One will be slide, 1.2 is slide 2.3, is slide 3, you're laying out the flow of the entire argument on that page. Let's look at a couple of executive summaries and they're going to look familiar in this first one. It's a layer approach and you've got the big bold headings and then you've got the supporting points and if you read that It's going to tell you a story. That's where it came from. Your story, becomes, your executive summary. And yes, you've done your wordsmithing. Now, you've made sure every word is perfect and deliberate. Now, I know this executive summary is a little on the dense side. I've been in some organizations where that's not only acceptable. It's actually expected. If your organization is a little bit more bullet e and they want shorter points. That's okay. Go ahead and bullet eyes the points. Provided the bullet makes sense on Its own, don't have a bullet that just says sales. Okay, sales, increasing your over year, I got it. Give them a complete thought, so they don't draw their own conclusions. And in this story, you see, you've got some background and what's changed. And the core idea with supporting points, And a column situation, your executive summary is also your story. The first line is your core idea. You're telling them right off the bat. This is exactly what I want you to do and why it's good for you and below that, are the major sections, your columns from that story, again, think through the sequence of these, because depending on who you're pitching to, you may want to talk about the financials first or maybe talk about the financials last depending on that audience, you Do need to tailor your executive summary and once you have your executive summary complete, that executive summary serves as the table of contents, for the rest of your presentation point, one is slide. 1.2 is slide 2.3 is slide 3. So let's take a step back and look at this entire process. You had a core idea and that helped you define an architecture. Also, having an understanding of your audience help you pick the right architecture a layer or a column. We then use that architecture to turn it into a story. And that architecture also told us what analyses we needed to do. Now, if you fast forward to the final presentation, your core idea is your title. Your story is your executive summary, and then all the analyses you did tied directly to each point in that executive summary. And those points in the summary, are the points that were on your architecture this entire process. Is pointing you to a final document. You just have to slow down and not start building your slides at the beginning. You got to get your logic straight before you dive into analysis and slides and if you follow the process rigorously and you have a logical architecture, you'll have a logical story. If you have a logical story, you'll have a logical presentation that has the right facts and analyses there, so your stakeholder can say, yes."
