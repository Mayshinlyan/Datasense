And for 7 years, I had the incredible job of finding new forever. Families for over 150, lucky dogs today. Watch along with me as I reflect on one of my favorites, a one-year-old Spaniel mix named Bean, who became a fashion model for an aspiring photographer and then join along with me for a picture-perfect reunions with bean and is adopters Liz. Samantha, and Sarah. This is Lucky. Dog reunions join Brandon. As he looks back at the story of being When a multi-talented puppy rescued, several years ago, beans, high level of energy and intelligence. Come on combined to take his training to another level go on and his sense of fashion. Immediately, endeared him to his new forever family. You are now Brandon will see how it all turned out. I'm Brandon McMillan and I've dedicated my life to saving the lonely. Unwanted dogs that are living without hope. My mission is to make sure these amazing animals, find a purpose, a family and a place to call home. Today, one dog will be saved and one family will have a new best friend. This is Lucky, Dog reunions.I'm headed down to North Central shelter. Apparently they have a year old Spaniel mix. They found on the streets as a stray. They said he's a great dog is very sweet. Gets along with people gets along with other dogs but for one reason or another. He's been there for a long time, this is a very common Story. The shelters are completely overflowing with dogs. That really good dogs, constantly get overlooked. And unfortunately, when that happens, their days are numbered such as the case, with this little guy, I knew that if I didn't get him Out of there. He wouldn't make it. So I get down there and rescue them see what I can do. Even from behind bars, beans? Sweet nature shines through you always kiss, like that invitation did make some room. All right, your friendly being wasted, no time with. Let me know that he was a friendliest dog in the world. He just jumped right in my lap and made himself comfortable convinced. Come on. Let's get out of here. Ready 123 lead the way that's the wrong way. There you go. Come on. Brendan takes being to Lucky Dog Ranch where he gives him his red training, collar and introduces him to the packed. And you got any go, go on, make some friends. Well you have them here. Welcome to the Lucky Dog. Ranch, beans Positive Vibes, catch on quickly among the other dogs and that's the kind of attitude that could make him a match for another full house today. I'll be doing a home Visit with the Tatum family to see if they're a good match for being. Hey how are you? Thank you for coming. Everybody's in fun. I'm Elizabeth I am a professional singer and a freelance bookkeeper and I live in Pasadena with my mom and my daughter, my name is Sarah, I've been retired as a science teacher librarian. We have a lot of the same Hobbies we like doing trivia. We like animals, all three of them wanted Dog for different reasons. Sarah wanted a dog for home protection. The first thing I thought of is, I don't know. Beans going to be great home protection. He's only 12 pounds but even the smallest dogs. Can be a good alarm, dog. It really will be good for a dog to be here with me when they are away, Elizabeth told me that she wanted a dog to take to work with her in my freelance, bookkeeping? One of the offices, I go to is very dog-friendly. So that would mean I would have a lot of training and testing to do to see if he'd work in an office environment. Aunt? And then Samantha told me she wants a dog just because that's what I want to hear. That's the easiest kind of client right there, but when she told me what she has aspirations of becoming, I got an idea in my head. Why do you like photography so much? I just like taking pictures and making memories and stuff like that. I've spent my entire career filming animals. So, that point, I had a great idea of what I was going to do with being to help her out. I have found a dog recently. He does sound like he fits the profile pic, exactly what you're looking for. He Seems very sweet, but I'm just still getting to know him right now. It's a long way to go before he's fully trained and I can release him to you. So with that said I'm going to get back to the ranch. Keep working on him and we'll be in touch good talking to you all. Thank you now, I think I have a really good game plan of what I'm going to do with bean and I think he's going to be very special for Samantha. Beans. Potential is a lap dog aside Brandon. First needs to find out what the sweet spaniel nose of the basics. Today, I'll be doing beans assessment of his knowledge of the seven common commands. Sit Stay Down. Come off heel and no, I try to have him. Sit, you sit. Now, you can jump. I see that. All right. That's one down. A lot of puppies, develop the jumping habit because when the puppy is very young, it's jumping up on everybody and everyone thinks it's cute. So they're like, oh, they Pick it up and they give it a reward because it's so cute. When the dog jumps, that's all fun and games until the dog hits a year or two, now it's an adult and jumping up on everyone. It becomes annoying, but it is now a bad habit. That was trained. How about now? Okay, you don't come, his heel was terrible. Give me a heel. I'm not even sure he ever had an odor. He could have been on the streets for a while so it's no surprise that he had basically little to no training. No, yeah. So now I know that he has very little training and he still a jumper It's time to get started coming up. See how Bean proves himself to be ready for a life in a home with cats? Oh my gosh, what is that?Each of the three members of beans, potential, new family has a different reason for wanting a dog. Which means that Brandon has three times the work in trying to make being a match for them. When I did a home, visit of the Tatum family, I found out. They had two cats. So, obviously being needs to be tested around cats to see if he's aggressive. So, I brought over a cat, that was a very experienced with dogs. This cat has been there and seen it all, but being obviously hadn't been there or seen anything. Being didn't even notice the cat at first until he did. He jumps on the couch, jumps off the couch shows, back on the couch, still doesn't noticed you have no idea. What's right behind you. Do you out of the corner of his eye, he sees the cat move. And next thing, you know, being is focused on this new strange animal right in front of his face. Oh my God. What is that? What is that? So we're looking dog, huh? He started freaking out. He had no idea what kind of dog. This was then suddenly when he did, he starts barking at it. It's not going to win him. Any brownie points with the cat and that cat is Just Chillin. Still not even fazed to get being a little more comfortable. I went ahead and sat on the couch right between him and the cat, it took a few minutes of the initial Jitters for him to get over it and then suddenly he starts slowly creeping closer to the cat. If there's one thing all cats have It's a comfort zone and once you cross over the line of that Comfort Zone, The cat will let you know. Boom. It's called a warning. The cat taught in the lesson that he needed to learn what I do like about this whole situation is being really showed, no aggression, he showed curiosity, and he showed that when he crossed the boundaries, he could deal with the fact that the cat might react, thankfully, no animals were harmed during the situation, the cat's claws, didn't connect with being it just gave him the warning that he needed to learn. In order for being to get acclimated to potential workplace, trips with Elizabeth, Brandon takes Bean to a local office building. The main thing I was looking for, were the dog in an office environment is they have basic manners. They have basic control and basic office, etiquette beans, not a puppy anymore. So I'm not worried about it being too destructive, but he can't disrupt the work day of everyone working there being was naturally, curious if everything in the office at first, but he got over it pretty quickly and he did pretty well when he met another. Dog. He didn't really care. He got curious with the trash can really quick but because he has the fundamentals of the no command. I simply said the word. No. And he stopped right away. So I really didn't see any problems of being in an office. Stay tuned to see how being transitioned from a shelter dog into a fashion model. Perfect. Good.Good good, there you go. Heel perfect. God in addition to the seven common commands one-year-old Spaniel mix, Bean has mastered the art of feline cohabitation and proper business behavior. When I did a home, visit of the Tatum family. I found out their daughter. Samantha is an aspiring photographer. She has a specific interest in shooting animals. I mean, so the last piece of the puzzle here was teaching being how to wear props, and costumes, and outfits for Samantha. The first thing I'll be starting out with is the Ascot those are look teaching a dog to wear these things is easier said than done, clothing typically is easy but when it comes to things like hats or sunglasses, It's Tricky, you have to do it in very short increments at first. So when I place the sunglasses on the dog, I take them off right away. I repeat the process until eventually Totally fine with them on his head. And now, he's an official performing dog. So, next I move on to the goggles. Watch this being was a pretty easygoing dog, so he didn't really care. So, what was one second. Now has five seconds and 10 and 30 seconds until eventually the dock and hold the Hat ends on glasses on his head, for two, three, four, five minutes at a time. The next prop I move onto is the hat and just like the rest of the props. I extend time as the hat is on his head, once he learned how to wear these outfits and hold these objects. On his head, The Obedience took over the rest of the way at that point. He was ready for his photo shoot. Of course, looks only go so far in the animal photography World. Brandon has something greater in mind for Samantha Dean was a very high intelligence and high energy dog. And when a dog has that combination was one sport. That's absolutely built for them that's agility. The secret is starting him at the ground floor. Literally, this is where I drop the hoop, all the way to the ground and now I take a treat, throw a through the hoop and he walks on through it. Same thing you go through, there you go. Good, I slowly inch hoop up a little more off the ground and eventually got to the point where being actually had to step over the hoop. And then it goes to the point where he actually had to jump to the hood but because he was conditioned over and over going to the whom he knew right away what to do. So what does he do? It's right through it. He now knows the hoop over the next few days. Brandon uses a similar technique to train, being to run through a tunnel. So again, with enough conditioning being gained confidence, and eventually he ran right through the tunnel and to jump a hurdle. Now, he's been trained to each obstacle separately. It's time to connect them all together as one course. Being proved that day that his high-level intelligence and has athleticism was perfect for the sport of agility, a launches over the High jump as if he's been doing this course. This whole life safe to say that he's built for this kind of thing. Up. Next, we'll look back in the day, when being met his forever family and starred in his first photo shoot, the boy.One-year-old Spaniel mix being has learned when not to jump now, it's up to his potential, new family, to take a leap. I told Samantha and her mother meet me here at the ranch and they had no idea why they're coming here, but they're about to get a big surprise. Welcome. Hi Monica. I bring them both to the training barn, and they quickly realize why they were here. Say hi to your new dog, babe. Surprise. Yeah, sing baby for the first time. You just seem like one of the best dogs in the world, be thought being there, and he just ran over to us. And that was just really exciting, because here's the super cute dog. He'll do a lot of that. Use your door Apple, when the family finally met being I demonstrated for Samantha. What her new dog? Could do you bring your camera with you? Yeah, it's in my bag. I had Both meet me down in the training yard. And from there, I wanted to show Samantha how much fun she can have with her camera. You had a special interest in shooting animals, right? Yeah. Well, you know, one of the best ways that you could at that is to shoot a lot of animals and the best way to shoot a lot of animals have your own, especially at the models, she got a camera out and started snapping shots being Formal Wear the outfits on the have the sunglasses. And of course, the agility course, this is a new world for Samantha. It took a little practice by. She got very good pretty quickly. So now Samantha Master, the modeling part. It's time to step it up a notch. You ready? Yep. Bean. Wow. Look at this. Nice been God. Look at this. That's amazing. After a quick refresher on each obstacle, it's time for being to prove that he can run the whole routine at once. Go get do, they're gone. Go Whole Hog all the way go on. Get in there. Get in there. Go on. Come on, come here. And from there, it was just one last thing to do in quite a number of years. Since I've seen this family, I'm really curious to see if Samantha has kept up her love for photography, but also, if being still does his agility and means go. Three, two, one. Be, it feels great to have another dog in my life and I'm glad we gave being a place to stay because this dog definitely needs a family in any family would be lucky to have him. So lucky, enjoy your life. I know, I'll miss those. Go on, don't go away. You won't want to miss this special reunions with being and his family. What's up being? Wow.Eight years ago, Brandon rescued bean and found him a home with Elizabeth Tatum. Now, for the first time since that day, they're about to reconnect with some stranger. Oh my gosh. Look who's here. It was a nice surprise to see Brandon being seem to remember Brandon immediately We went right up to him and give him a nice kiss. You recognize only remembers you recognize me. He is doing great. Let's sit down. Get reacquainted okay. That sounds great. So how many years has it been eight? I'm losing count. It just seems to go very quickly. So, what's up, dude? You looking good? Sorry. Remember when I got them for the whole family. Yes, you were all going to just evenly. Split him, whose dog, the really end up being. I really do think he enjoys all of our company and he It has a routine. So when my daughter's home, he likes to spend sometimes with her and then in the morning he spend some time with my mom and then he'll spend time with me and I work from home mostly. So we never really chose anybody know. It's very rare being really spends kind of an equal amount of time. With each one of us, I feel really fortunate to have been become a member of our family. You gotta keep up with her talker. Yeah, she's still doing that actually. Majored in animation and some of that does include photography. Yeah. What about his agility? Yeah, I've been terrible about keeping up with it. He still said you can absolutely jump over a couch. Yeah. I mean, he seems that pretty a joust. Oh yeah, he's nine. Yeah, yeah. I know. It's hard to tell if I didn't know them. Yeah. Well I mean I don't really have much to be stressed about. No, it's got a very nice life, Millie Millie does. So when I had him, I trained him to be in the office environment. Was he going to the office with you? Yeah. Regularly, and that was great because the owner had the dog there and so they could play and interact and he was just happy to be there and it was just nice to be able to take him and you have a different environment for the day that was really nice to be able to have him there during the day. It also made me get out and walk around a little bit. What about his obedience? He kept up with that. I have kept up with his other training good so he still knows his commands, his good recall well unless there's The skunk in the yard of course unless you got let him learn on his own by the way. Yeah, he won't go around the skunk twice trust me out dude. Yeah, but other than that it's good with his down and the least walking and visiting learned a couple of more tricks. Like what a friend of my daughter's taught him high five and how to shake? Yeah well I mean any daughter learns agility? Yeah you know that's just high-level intelligence with athleticism, right? How did he get along with your cat? He would have To play with the cat all the time. The cat does sort of tolerated him. Yeah, the cat pretty much ignored him but being was very mellow with him. So now you've had him for all these years. You know, I was little funny quirks. What are they one thing? You really enjoy is if we're out for a walk and he says a staircase or maybe a tunnel, he'd really curious about it, he wants to investigate it. What does he do? Season is okay, gotta go up here. See, what's that? Yeah, so he just treats it like a little agility course I guess. So It's not kind of like him, dropping the hints and yeah, I'm going to have to look for beans, agility equipment, that would be a fun thing to work on again, that we just been a really good. And while these yes you turned out to even be a better companion. Yeah. And we had even hoped for so we completed the family. Absolutely. That's what I want to hear. Yeah thank you once again it's time for Brandon to say goodbye to little bean there. You guys about That's office. The boy. Go to your mama. Take care of me. Thank you. Thank you so much. It could be so great to see you, you too. I am so grateful for the training and care that being got from Brandon. I know it helped him fit so well into our family. He's a really smart dog and he already was a great dog to begin with. I could see and I'm really grateful that we got to have him. Come into our lives, from hopeless to a home. That's my mission one dog at a time."

I'm Mo Rocca and today will astonish you. Coming up the Precision. Sprinkle with the lawn has a wrinkle the new electric fate for engines, V8 an update. We beckon. So today is the check-in and their Creations Dynamic for pottery ceramic. That's next on the Henry Ford's Innovation Nation. One of my household jobs is a kid, was to water the lawn. Now I wasn't a set out the sprinkler. Then go inside and watch TV. Waterer. I was a squeeze, the handle of the spray gun with a sweeping side to side, perfect pattern. Waterer. I also may have watered my brother's once in a while, which was usually followed up with me in a headlock and far more drenched than they were. And, you know, the neighbor's dog might have gotten a spritzer to well, now there's a device to make your lawn watering Very precise. Here's Albert. Lawrence to explain. Water is the Earth's most vital resource? So managing it wisely is a top priority. One area of concern is landscape irrigation where as much as 60% of the water is wasted due to run off and overspraying by sprinklers. But these two guys Shane Dyer and Gary kleinfelter turned ink printing on paper into water printing on grass. I took a trip to Woodside California. Nia to learn how to perfectly water any shaped Lon but they're high-tech system called Eerie green. What is your green are? During makes a digital sprinkler system. User like robotic sprinklers. That uses, this really interesting printing technology instead of spraying. So the water streams don't overlap which means you're using about half the water for the same green grass grow instead of having sprinkler heads all around the outside, you replace like, you know, six to eight sprinkler heads with one. Had that sits in the middle and you'll go from like 40 heads for a house down to only five heads to cover the entire house. What made you think that you can marry this idea of a printer with Lawn Care? The idea I came up with looked at the problem is a bunch of doughnuts around the sprinkler head. You have small donuts on the inside and bunch bigger Donuts on the outside and streams of water that match those doughnuts. And the reason you need to stream the water is because you need to be be able to vary it from 5 to 30 feet and maintain that uniformity, which you can't do with the spray ear. Agreeing zap. Lets you map out a watering pattern in any shape you need, right? From your phone, Shane. And Gary showed me how it works, that is impressive, the fact that it can go that wide. But what happens when you get to something like this pizza slice, well let's hit the play button here. So as this is coming around, you'll notice that that, you know, just following Exact shape for the lawn right there. And then when it comes on over, it's going to hit the V and we've set up a little bit, wait for it right on the edge of that V won't bring through. And then extend back through all the way through on the other side. Are you confident enough for me to stand right in the center, right in the pizza? Slice, if you to guarantee me that I won't get wet? Absolutely, absolutely. Okay, I took my position praying technology. Wouldn't fail me and we keep the lawn wet but not the Albert. Look the way that it cut that corner, precise and dry. I okay, I'm a Believer now. After a break, the new old car class to Electric from gas. We went from the how to where are they now and they filled the buffet these women of clay. But first, it's time for the mo, you know, I'm going to toss out two words that will whet your appetite Pizza. Okay, I know it's actually one word but we're talking about deep dish pizza, which is kind of twice as filling as The pizza. So we'll just call Pizza two words for the sake of argument and this Mo, you know. So where was it? Deep dish pizza invented. Was it a Buffalo New York be Eugene Oregon? Or she Chicago Illinois you toss around those choices and we'll see which guess is supreme after a quick break. Welcome back. Hope you're ready for a slice of knowledge with extra cheese. A moment ago, we asked the need to know question where was the deep dish pizza invented? If you said c, Chicago Illinois then you are correct. The earliest record of pizza, as we know it dates back to the 18th century in Naples Italy and Pete's arrived in the United States starting in the late 19th century along with a wave of Italian immigrants. Pizza got a second helping of popularity in America with the development of distinct regional types. One of those being the deep dish pizza from Chicago. Deep dish, pizza is baked in a deep pan, which creates high edges and ample space for large amounts of cheese and tomato sauce. According to Pizza. Historians. Wait can I have that job? Okay, Pizza historians pinpoint the introduction of the Chicago-style deep dish pizza to 1943. And it's been a Chicago thing ever since. And that boxes up another segment of the mo. You know, you've probably heard the saying everything old is new again, which basically means that we've seen it all before. Now, the new here, it's pretty much the same with cars. You might think that hybrid and electric cars are so today. But in reality, some of the very first cars ran on batteries, of course, there are people who never want to give up their cool classic cars for Ours, it seemed to be the future of automobiles. Well, now, everything old can be new again. There are innovators giving a charge to vintage cars. Here's Jack string. Kita to explain, imagine taking to the highways, like this, with the free spirit, that seems at one with the look of classic cars. But without chronic maintenance headaches, that's the business of the electric where they take Their favorite Classics and give them a clean, electric internal makeover. David Bernardo is the founder of selectric and I met him in San Diego, to talk shop. Run me through what it takes to actually take a car from the 50s and turn it into a. Modern-day electric vehicle on the simpler side. We just take out the gasoline. Engine take out the gas tank, put in an electric motor and put in batteries where the gas tank was and a few hundred electrical connections here. They get involved in much more than swapping out an engine with a motor. They upgrade the brakes suspension. And steering. Give love to those retro window winders and windshield wipers and pay attention to every last gleaming detail. As for sourcing, the motors in some cases, they repurpose them from cars that have been in Rex, they also Source brand new motors made by companies with many years of experience. How does the drive train on one of these cars differ from, you know the before times to what you guys have done to it, the electric motor that's right onto the existing manual transmission. So you Can shift through the gears for a second. Third, fourth, fifth or you can also just drive it like an automatic. I love this one. Wow, it's so clean in there. This is the electric motor that bolts right onto a 50 year old transmission. My driving. Are you driving? Oh, you're driving. Hop in. I don't think we have a 100-mile range in the car, huh? This is 77%. We have so we have 77, well, Ranch that's it. Here we go. Wow and stealthily we return to base even though I wanted to experience this quiet. Cool throwback all afternoon that was so rad again again when we come back their ideas we spread but did they go ahead? And some catch our games but all use the glaze. But first it's time for the mo you know, thanks to social media lighting seems more important these days than at any other time. If it's too bright, you get all squinty and nobody wins the key to any lighting is getting the wattage. Just right, which brings us to today's Illuminating question. So, how was the dimmer switch? Originally marketed? Was it a to? Eight mood lighting, be for growing plants, indoors or C4 lighting to ease you into sleep, you light into those choices and we'll see which one illuminates after a quick break.Welcome back up moment ago, we asked the glowing question. How was the dimmer switch originally marketed? If you said a for mood lighting then you shine bright because you are correct. In 1959. Physicist, Joel Spira was tinkering in his Manhattan apartment. When he invented a way to reduce the light output of an incandescent bulb Spyro's Innovation, was the first lighting dimmer for domestic use. Was smaller cooler energy efficient and it could fit into a home wall box. Spira patented the dimmer and created a company Lutron which marketed the light dimmer the Capri as mood lighting. Capitalizing on the idea that low lighting is great for Aesthetics and coziness. Lutron estimates its light controls have reduced customers electric bills by 1 billion dollars annually. And that's lights out on another segment of the mo, you know, have you ever tried to buy tickets to a popular concert or do an online auction where you have to keep refreshing your page? The refreshing is essential to show you where things stand. We're no different on this show. We've profiled, hundreds of inventors and innovators. Now, it's our turn to click on refresh to update where some of our past guests stand today. For our first update, we travel back in time to the very Inception of our beloved show. That's when Adam Yamaguchi introduced us to risk to Phi a personal thermostat. You can wear like, a watch, chew hot to cold. A simple Twist of a dial can control your body's temperature is essentially to revolutionize how we think about technology to make technology. That isn't simply useful but actually feels good. Now, the team has engineered a smaller Longer and colder version called The Wave. It's designed to relieve hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. The wave targets, the temperature, sensitive skin, on the inner wrist, delivering cooling, or warming, thermal waves. Our next update is also cool in season, 3 out Awards. Showed us the V, Ernest turbine, The Versatile, way to harness River Power. What's different about voter notices that? It's an individual device that deploys directly into rivers. So you don't have to build a big damn. You don't have to build any big infrastructure since our story aired Ted and his team have sealed a deal on a multi-year contract with the US Army Corps of Engineers to build deploy and Test 2 sizes of V earnest. A backpack size and a 3 meter diameter scale which is about the size of a speedboat way to go Ted. Of course the biggest one comes right, then she Albert Lawrence paddling this kayak. If he looks nervous, it's because it's made of a single folded sheet of corrugated plastic, origami style somehow inventor Anton, Willis, figured out how to fold the 12-foot kayak into a lightweight carrying case. I read this magazine article about origami so that just got me to thinking, you know, would it be possible to make a kayak that folded up like a sheet of paper since our Intrepid correspondent first? The water Anton has created a slew of new models. The biggest news he's developed a new folding technique that makes the boats even lighter and faster and get this. The new models can go from box to boat in less than three minutes. Talk about Rocking the Boat. Coming up their talents, they would show with wet clay to throw that endmill capillary are up next. Potter fans have been around since way back when the first book came out, it brought us, Muggles quidditch and made magic wands of thing again where you didn't have to say bibbity or bobbity. I'm sorry. What putter we? Well, that's different. Never mind, all that. So when you add that, why to Potter, you open up a vast story about American art, pottery with Vivid chapters on the colors, the glazes, the shapes, and the history. And to think it all started. Centuries ago with fancy ladies painting, China to pass the time art pottery and China. Painting begins in the mid to late part of the 1800s when young women of great social Shal means and financial means or encouraged to decorate China. I met up with curator Charles table to learn more about art, Pottery, the wealthy women behind the movement and the successful industry. They created, what is art pottery? Art? Pottery is ceramics that were made mostly by women but to decorate the home, not utilitarian, it can be utilitarian. But the primary purpose is decorative things. Like plates or vases and what these young women did in the mid. Late 19th century was painted floral forms on them pictorial scenes, a lot of these women, some of them become very accomplished. So who are the early prominent exponents of this of art Pottery a woman named Mary Louise, McLaughlin she lived in Cincinnati was very wealthy and her sort of Nemesis a woman named Mariah Longworth Nichols, and these women are known as we're known as the dueling divas of art pottery and open a pottery. Throw down. Absolutely. And they sort of push each other to become better. One could argue that they did. It was this Tit for Tat and the whole result was that our Pottery moved ahead, both technically and artistically. What about women who were not to the manor, born, the most important of these was a woman named Susan, Frack Alton, and she raised her family on what she made. An art Pottery. She then went off and started a studio in Milwaukee to teach women, how to Produce art Pottery in the 1880s, but even more importantly than that, she published a book and it was a manual for women to teach women how to paint pottery China, Etc. What is the legacy of art Pottery today? The beginning of female Liberation, women's Liberation in the Victorian period of the nineteenth Century women were homebound. They were not allowed to work. Professionally art Pottery began the transition of moving women outside the home in. To the Work World, they produce things like books, associations, which led into museums, they experimented with glazes and produce new types of glazes that were unknown in America. And ultimately created an art, Pottery industry for America. It's an important Legacy and might I add a beautiful one, I would totally agree. Just ahead. She keeps our Words true with definitions, as the glue Ali. Ward is next with Mo cab you Larry.Welcome back. You know who doesn't like a canoe ride on glassy Waters? It reminds me of the soothing sound of well said sentences. Hey just like you might need a doc to touch base. Perhaps you need some definitions of the words that have left you feeling adrift and that is why I've consulted, a doctor Ranieri, a dictionary to get the meaning of today's bigger words. He knew, even believe it, we call this vocabulary. Now, an Albert story about the sprinkler that makes the most. Moisture. This was said the reason you need to stream. The water is because you need to be able to vary it from 5 to 30 feet and maintain uniformity. So, uniformity is a noun and it means the state of being the same regularity. So when it comes to quenching the plants thirst, they crave, some predictability in those bursts. I'm just, you know, out here, sprinkling knowledge about this field. Now, in Jackson story about classic cars, with Modern modifications. This was said, how does the drive train on one of these cars differ from, you know, the before times to what you guys have done to it. So a drivetrain is some vehicular vocab and it's a noun that means the part that connects the transmission with the axles of a car. So yes, despite train being in that word, it has nothing to do with a choo-choo conductor but rather it's the car park. It keeps you motoring forward down the road but what happens once a an automaker? Automates, the process of assembly. Well, you get drivetrain uniformity. And that is your vocabulary for the day. I'm Ally, Ward. Thank you so much for joining us today. Remember, if you want to be on the Henry Ford's Innovation Nation one day, you need to dream big and don't quit. I'm Mo Rocca"
