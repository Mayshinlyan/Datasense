# X GitHub Team and Project Repository Template

**tl;dr** Register your X team or project on
[https://goto.corp.google.com/x-github-licenses](go/x-github-licenses) and use
this template to create your repository once your team has been created.

## X Source Code

(adapted from
[goto.corp.google.com/source-code-guidelines#definitions](go/source-code-guidelines#definitions))

**X Source Code** is source code (and all its dependencies, including binary
dependencies) used to build X applications, systems, and services, as well as
code that X employees or members of the extended workforce create or modify as
part of their job. To qualify as X source code, X does not have to be the
author, copyright holder, or owner of the code.

X source code includes the following data:

-   Human readable descriptions of a program.
-   Data that is stored or used together with source code, such as
    configuration, documentation, media, or help text.
-   Human-readable artifacts derived from source code (for example, generated
    code).
-   Data used for automated testing.
-   Third-party code and open source code
-   Experimental source code created or modified by employees or members of the
    extended workforce as part of their job.

## Security Responsibilities

The [XCS](https://github.com/orgs/theteamatx/teams/xcs) and
[Nebula](https://github.com/orgs/theteamatx/teams/x-nebula) teams handle all
of these responsibilities for you. We follow a
[strict set of guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8noF23CZ5VCXxfawJsi_LA6D1_Ul2iUAT03DErRosk/edit#heading=h.rvz2105bd83z)
